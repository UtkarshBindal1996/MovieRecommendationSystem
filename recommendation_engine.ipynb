    "### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "##### User-based Collaborative Filtering (CF):\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Concept:</b> User-based CF identifies users with similar taste in movies (neighbors) and recommends movies those neighbors enjoyed but the target user hasn't seen yet. These neighbours can be identified through various methods based on the use case. <br/>\n",
    "One way to go about it is to use K-nearest neighbours based on adjusted cosine similarity. This would identify users who have rated similar movies with similar ratings and then see what else they liked to suggest to you. One potential problem here is that since we only look at a small subset of people around you, we might miss out on popular trends. For example, if Game of thrones comes out but people in the small subset haven't rated it highly, then if wouldn't get recommended. <br/>\n",
    "In order to also catch these kinds of trends it would make sense to see a larger set of users, one way to do this is to choose a miuch large k value in k nearest neibours which would effectively take into account a cluster of users similar to you. This would be equivalent to doing a kmeans algorithm to get this cluster. The predictions can be made using weighted average of the ratings of the users in your cluster, weighted by similarity scores. This would give more importance to the users more similar to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Similarity Calculation:</b> We can calculate pairwise similarity between users using adjusted cosine similarity. This measures how closely aligned their rating vectors are, considering the direction of their ratings\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Considerations:</b>\n",
    "- We are using adjusted cosine since it's possible some users tend to rate enverything higher and some everything lower.\n",
    "- There exists a likely scenario that there isn't much overlap between the movies 2 people have rated. This is one of the major downsides of this kind of approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Although, a case can be made that users not having rated the same movies does carry some significance from case to case.\n",
    "\n",
    "  For example, if 2 users only have a Netflix subscription, it is likely that they haven't rated movies that are Hotstar exclusives. Moreoever, it would not make sense to receommend them movies exclusive to Hotstar.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Another example of the relevance of not rating the same movies would be if the languages of the movies is something they don't speak. English movie watchers would not have rated Japanese movies which should mean they have similar taste in a way.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Ultimately, it would really be based on <b>how the data was collected and and from which users</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### New features we can consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Time based importance:</b> We can add a term to add weight to more recent reviews since the older recommendations can be considered a little stale. This will basically be included in the similarity calculation."
